Questionnaire project presentation
----------------------------------

### Members:
* Yee Tung (Alice) Man - Producer (Analyzer) - aliceman@berkeley.edu
* Jinsoo Lee - Entrepreneur (Visualizer) - jinsoolee@berkeley.edu
* Kuanwei Tseng - Integrator (Presenter) - kt0009@berkeley.edu
* Jie Zhang - Administrator (Curator) - jzhang980@berkeley.edu


### Project goal:
Through the process of examining the data collected in the questionnaire, 
we explore different tools to handle and interpret the underlying relationship of the data and
build reproducible code for visualization.

### Presentation outline:
* Data cleaning (1 min 30 secs)
* Visualization (1 min)
* Conclusion (30 secs)

### Reproducibility: 
* The code is 100% reproducible. All you need is our end product at the ipython notebook, your google account and internet connection. We have integrated everything to work within python, including plotting graphs in R.
* To ensure the visualization part works properly, you will have your matplotlib, numpy, pandas, rpy/rpy2 and rmagic package installed in python. Also, make sure your system contains R.
